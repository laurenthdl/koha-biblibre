$0: removes items from selected biblios

This utility is meant to be run as part of the upgrade to
Koha 3.4.  It removes the 9XX fields in the bib records that
store a (now) duplicate copy of the item record information.  After
running this utility, a full reindexing of the bibliographic records
should be run using rebuild_zebra.pl -b -r.

Parameters:
    -where                  use this to limit modifications to selected biblios
    --run                   perform the update
    --help or -h            show this message
