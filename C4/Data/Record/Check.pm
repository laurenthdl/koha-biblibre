( $countlinked, $countcreated ) = BiblioAddAuthorities($record, $frameworkcode);

this function finds the authorities linked to the biblio
    * search in the authority DB for the same authid (in $9 of the biblio)
    * search in the authority DB for the same 001 (in $3 of the biblio in UNIMARC)
    * search in the authority DB for the same values (exactly) (in all subfields of the biblio)
OR adds a new authority record
 if the authority is found, the biblio is modified accordingly to be connected to the authority.
 if the authority is not found, it's added, and the biblio is then modified to be connected to the authority.
