INCREMENT=$1

BIBLIOEND=$3
# this script rebuild the zebra index recursively
# BIBLIOSTART is the record number to BIBLIOSTART on
# BIBLIOEND is the record number to BIBLIOEND on
# increment specify how many records we must try at once
# At the BIBLIOEND of each "chunk", this script checks if the indexing process has been OK
# if it hasn't, the slice is splitted in 10, and the reindexing is called again on each smaller chunk
# if the increment goes to 1, it means we tried to reindex 1 by 1, and the failing indexing concern wrong records

# the logs are stored in a directory called logs/ that must be a subdirectory of reindex.zsh

# at the BIBLIOEND of the script, just type :
#grep -l "previous transaction" `ls rebuild1.*.err`
# the result contains all the biblios that have not been indexed
# WARNING : the numbers are not the biblionumber but the record number, they can be reached by :
# SELECT biblionumber FROM biblio LIMIT YourNumberHere,1;

# EXAMPLE to run the script on a 800 000 biblios database :
# ./reindex.zsh 50000 0 800000
# will reindex the DB, BIBLIOSTARTing with chunks of 50k biblios
