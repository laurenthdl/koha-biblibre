=head1 DESCRIPTION

# Here is an exemple of a simple phony webservice, returning "Hello World" if the user is authenticated
# The purpose is to show how CAS Proxy can work with koha
# In this configuration, this page acts as a CAS Client, instead of the user's browser.
# This page is meant to be called from a foreign application

=head1 CGI PARAMETERS
